# **Introduction**
The Push_swap project is a very simple and highly effective algorithm project: data will need to be sorted. You have at your disposal a set of int values, 2 stacks and a set of instructions to manipulate both stacks.
<br/><br/>
Your goal ? Write a program in C called `push_swap` which calculates and displays on the standard output the smallest program using Push_swap instruction language that sorts the integer arguments received.

<br/><br/><br/>

# **Goals**
 - To write a sorting algorithm is always a very important step in a coder’s life, because it is often the first encounter with the concept of complexity.
 <br/><br/>
 - Sorting algorithms, and their complexities are part of the classic questions discussed during job interviews. It’s probably a good time to look at these concepts because you’ll have to face them at one point.
 <br/><br/>
 - The learning objectives of this project are rigor, use of C and use of basic algorithms. Especially looking at the complexity of these basic algorithms.
 <br/><br/>
 - Sorting values is simple. To sort them the fastest way possible is less simple, especially because from one integers configuration to another, the most efficient sorting algorithm can differ.
